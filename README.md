![Overview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87b380a9-80c0-4306-8262-c4c84be0b4ab)

## Introduction

This dashboard was created for **players of career mode on the game FC 25** to solve a common problem: selecting the right team and signing the correct players can make or break the enjoyment of a career mode. This project provides a single, easy-to-use interface to explore how different teams and leagues compare with stats and insights that aren't easily available in game.

### Dashboard File
You can find the file for the dashboard here: [`FC 25 League Dashboard.pbix`](https://github.com/tom-wilmott/PowerBI-Projects/blob/main/FC%2025%20League%20Dashboard.pbix).  

## Skills Showcased

This project utilised key Power BI features. Here's a look at what I mastered:

-   **⚙️ Data Transformation (ETL) with Power Query:** Cleaned, shaped, and prepared the raw data for analysis by handling blanks, changing data types, and creating new columns.
-   **🧮 Implicit Measures:** Formulated measures to derive key insights and KPIs like `Average Overall` and `Average Value`.
-   **📊 Core Charts:** Utilised **Column, Bar, Line,** and **Area Charts** to compare league current overall against their potential.
-   **🗺️ Geospatial Analysis:** Leveraged **Map Charts** to visualise the global distribution of players.
-   **🔢 KPI Indicators & Tables:** Used **Cards** to display key metrics and **Tables** to provide granular, sortable data.
-   **🎨 Dashboard Design:** Designed an intuitive and visually appealing layout, exploring both common and uncommon chart types to best tell the data story.
-   **🖱️ Interactive Reporting:**
    -   **Slicers:** To dynamically filter the report by league.
    -   **Buttons & Bookmarks:** To create a seamless navigation experience.
    -   **Drill-Through:** To navigate from a high-level summary to a contextual, detailed view.
